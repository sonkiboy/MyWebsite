                This is a collection of my weekly development updates for <a href="DungeonMole.html">Dungeon Mole</a>. The game was developed as my Capstone project for Game Studio Production at Columbia College Chicago. I have been the main designer and programmer for this project so much of my tasks were related to creating and desinging gameplay elements along with communicating with a team of artists to create assets for the game. Each week we would post on a Microsoft Teams page what we were working on, and then a follow up before we met the next week. We are currently 15 weeks into production and expect to ship in May 2025.

            <div class="row" >
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                    Leading up to the first week of the semester, I created two rough prototypes of game ideas to choose between and pitch to the studio class. One of those two prototypes was a top-down 2D version of Dungeon Mole. The choice to do 2D was a safe bet, as if I wasn't able to get any 3D artists on the project, I could handle making the spirtes. It also would simplyfy the process of dealing with physics and quickly protyping visuals.<br>
                    Once I pitched the project we had 3 artists; Evelyn a concept artist, Larry a 3D modeler, and Kyle a general artist. Oliver who was another programmer in the class also had an interest in the project, yet also still wanted to work on his own game idea. <br>
                    As a result we had 2 teams formed, one for Dungeon Mole, and one for Olivers project "Arcana Forge". While Oliver and I mostly stuck to our own projects since we were the only programmers for each respective game, the three artists would bounce between projects as was needed. However, Oliver did come in to assist every now and then when I was dealing with things outside the class.

                    You are a Gardening Mole seeking to protect his garden home from the underground insect threat. While you cannot attack on your own, you can plant defenses throughout the underground dungeon to defend and destroy enemy defenses. But be careful, the insects will make large pushes on the exit every so often, so make sure you head back to defend before the next wave arrives. Explore the dungeon to find many unique seeds, discover powerful plant combos, and defend the garden from insect annihilation! <br>

                    Main focus for me is working on getting a new version of the prototype built in 3D. <br>
                    Specific things I'm aiming to get working for this week:<br>
                    Basic Test Room<br>
                    Working Player controller<br>
                    Getting Slingshot plant working <br>
                    I'll be creating the repo and project file on Tuesday once I figure out what version of unity we should use. <br>
                    <br>
                    This is what I got so far in terms of the 3D prototype. Just have movement, basic camera, and the sling working in the 3D environment. Wanted to also get the root wall plants but had an idea to make them grow out and cover more ground so I'll need some more time to get that working

                    Main focus is going to be getting basic enemy AI implemented and getting more familiar with using Navmesh. Currently having some good results so I’m also going to look into getting the blockade plants set up. I’m thinking instead of having the blockade plants only take up one unit, I want to have it grow and block up to 3 spaces, either randomly or chosen by the player<br><br>
                    Heres the current state of the prototype, got the root wall plants working and reworked them so they can grow in the 4 cardinal directions like a snake. I also have enemy pathfinding and spawners working, will need to rework to stop spawning after they have enough enemy's on the field.  Next focus is probably going to be getting the planting working with some sort of UI element to select what seed to use

                    Get the prototype done! A lot of the content is in there but the big thing I want to focus on is getting the planting system working with a ui element to select what seed to plant. I got the ui working so now it’s going to be about defining which tiles are dirt tiles that can be planted on. Not sure exactly how I want to do that but I have some ideas regarding tile pallets  and colliders<br><br>
                    This is the current state of the project. Got the planting system working but could use some refinement down the line when it comes to the tile selection system. Also not fully committed to using unity grid maps to place dirt, but is the best solution I have currently found

                    Create a component that can be added to a plant and the player to show where the player input it aiming. This component should be scalable and able to be put on any object so it doesn't need to be built for each and every plant. The component should also have different modes of aiming, like a line for the Sling shot, or tile aim for the planting and root walls.<br><br>
                    Got aim working as a component we can add to stuff like plants to render an aim icon. Currently has two modes: Linear and Grid. Linear shoots a straight line from its origin in the given Aim direction, while grid highlights the grid tile at the aim position. It can pretty easily be added to plant scripts so this should be easy to add to stuff down  the line

                    Main goal is to get digging working for the player so they can dig up plants that are in the game world and get their seed back. This will then be stored and managed in the inventory manager script to determine what players can plant

                    Main focus of this week will be getting a enemy wave system in place so we can get one step closer to give the player a win condition. In each room there will be a set number of enemy spawners that will activate when the player gets a set distance into the level. Since the rooms will be made as predetermined individual prefabs we can place these triggers by hand with colliders instead of tracking time or player distance. Once all the spawners are taken care of then the door to the next room will open up. This will be different from the bosses which will be dealt with in a future week.<br>
                    Due to scheduling issues outside of school, I was not able to complete last weeks task, so in addition to the wave system, I will be also implementing the inventory system and seed distribution.

            <div class="row" >
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                    This week I will be experimenting and starting to plan out a RTS style economy focused on the gameplay loop on a per-room basis. Last Friday we had a discussion with David about how the player gains power when fighting in a room, and how to encourage a more defensive play style. <br>
                    <br>
                    Current Idea:<br>
                    In each room there will be mineral deposits scattered around the room, these can be mined to gather a fertilizer that can be spent to power up the plants you have out on the field. These deposits can be chipped away at, rather than mined all at once. As the player chisels at it, pieces will break off that the player can pick up, but over time the deposit will shrink and eventually run out, forcing the player to look for other deposits. The fertilizer can be used on a "per-plant" basis, meaning that fertilizing a plant will only affect that single instance of that plant. For example, if I have two projectile plants and I fertilize one of them, that one will be powered up while the other projectile plant will not. Fertilized plants will have better stats, range, or even special abilities, and will remain powered up until they are dug up. The idea behind this is that the player will walk into a room, be drawn to the nearest mineral deposit, throw up some basic defenses, and start digging away at the deposit while fighting off the early weak waves of enemies. After they build up enough fertilizer from the deposit, they will start powering up their plants to make a push and attack the enemy spawners.<br>
                    <br>
                    This will take multiple weeks to fully execute, but this week will be mainly focused on adding the mineral mining mechanic, tracking how much the player has gathered, and giving the player the ability to use this on the plants (Plant evolutions will come later). 
 
                    
                </div>
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                    Heres a video demoing the work I got in this week with some extra explanations, but in summary here's what I got:<br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plants can now be dug up to get back their seed</li>
                        <li>Item drops that the player can pick up when near</li>
                        <li>Mineral deposits that the player can mine with their shovel to gain fertilizer, but will eventually run out </li>
                        <li>Reworked inventory system to work off Scriptable Objects</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Next week will revolve around getting the plant power up system working where the player can use fertilizer to powerup their plants. Next play test will be focused on seeing if the players will actually build bases near the fertilizer deposits and how effective the loop of "Set up, mine, push/attack, repeat" really is

                    This week is a continuation of last weeks task where I will be focusing on creating a system to fertilize plants and have them evolve. When the player evolves a plant it will gain stat increases and change visually. Like stated last time, evolving a plant will only change that instance of a plant, so it wont change any other plants of the same type, and when you dig up an evolved plant, replanting it will revert it back to its basic state.<br>
                    
                    I will also be adding in the new UI elements that Evelyn is making this week and making sure it updates as their values change (Health hearts decrease, item icons swap around, etc.)

I want to refine the current prototype just enough to the point where I can gather accurate data without bugs or performance issues being in the way.<br>
                    <br>
                    From my investigations on some of the bugs listed in the notes doc, we have some issues with how we are using the imported room model. First thing I noticed is that when we use the mesh collider, it sometimes auto generates in a way that literally cuts corners. I included a picture of how this shows up, with the dark blue lines outlining the mesh, while the red is the autogenerated collider based on the mesh. Along the same lines, I discovered the issue where the player clips through the floor on the sling is a result of the player clipping into the room collider and going right through due to the dirt areas having a slightly raised section with the dirt layered on top. This also interferes with the enemy AI as the nav mesh cant always navigate onto that<br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    This is not on the fault of anyone, but I think we do need to change up our strategy to make sure we are in control of the colliders. Going forward the room mesh and the colliders of the room object should be separate objects that share a parent obj like the enemies and player objects. I know we haven't had a defined plan for level design and how that workflow will look like, but with some of the major features almost in place, I think we should start planning for that. For Friday I'm going to try and grey box a new smaller room that is designed with the newer mechanics in mind. From there I want to see how easy it would be to separate the grey box mesh from its colliders, see if we can export those meshes to Maya for Kyle and Larry to model over, then export that back into Unity. If everything works out we should be able to keep grey box collisions to use in the final room model to save on time, and keep the geometry simple and in our control.

                    Here is a grey box room I made with the new mechanics in mind. I wanted to play with the idea of having bridges being blocked off by the wall plants so you can control the pathing of enemies, and I like the idea but there isn't much of a way to take advantage of it other than just making the enemies take longer to get to you. I also tried thinking of where the players are going to be setting up base, which can depend on what path you take. One bridge is a bit harder to navigate sine it has less dirt space, but can flank two hives and put you right next to an ore deposit. I'll be interested to see how this works in play test, feel like it will point out a lot of holes in the design and give a good idea of where to go going forward<br><br>

                    This week I want to focus on getting a concrete idea of how I want to teach the mechanics of the game to player, reduce the amount of things the player has to do, and make it easier to quickly understand what each action does, and what interactions are occurring in the game. This all comes together under the task of tutorializing the game and thinking of what first time players are going to be thinking. I honestly doubt all of this will get done within the week, but I want to start thinking of how this is all going to come together and creating a plan since this will be put in peoples hands in a few weeks.
                    <br><br>
                     Heres my weekly demo video. Main things to take note are the Ui changes, the player aim reticle, and the input changes<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>UI Changes</b>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Selected items pops out when swapped too
                        next and previous item slots are greyed out to be less noticeable and show they aren't immediately ready to use</li>
                        <li>Fertilizer counter pops out when value changed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Aim Reticle</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A semi transparent arrow is now positioned infront of the player to show what they are aiming at and what action they are about to perform</li>
                        <li>when an interactable object like a plant or mineral deposit is infront of the player, the reticle arrow will snap onto the top of that object based on its center</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                   
                    
                    <b>Input Changes</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All actions bound to either A or B on the controller (see main post for the positive and negative input explanation) and changes depending on what the player is or isn't selecting</li>
                        <li>The dig action has been changed from an item to the B button option for any object that it is applicable too (ie. plants or minerals)</li>
                        <li>Fertilize is still a seperate button however, and is bound to the trigger. This may change to be the A button action for the sprout stage of plants if the plant evolution method is changed or removed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Since it's the holiday this week this will be a bit more of a smaller week in terms of scale, but still a very important one! With the new inputs in place and the actions more finalized, I want to start adding a UI overlay that will give important info to the player depending on what they are doing <br>
 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selecting an object will display the commands the player can make and their respective button</li>
                        <li>Selecting a plant will show a dial that indicates how much fertilizer it needs until it evolves to the next stage </li>
                        <li>When the player picks up an item, a sprite will pop up above the player that shows how much they have gained (+1)</li>
                    </ul>
                        
                    This will help a lot with teaching the player how to play the game and not have to halt action to remember the controls. While this probably wont be an issue after the player has played for a while, it will help save time when playtesting and introducing the game to new comers. <br>
                    
                    I will also be working on a short 30 - 60 second long high light reel for the Columbia Gala, showing off the game and it's current state. Since the dead line on that is 12/1 I will be working on that first and thus will probably not include some of the features listed above. However the UI additions are not for visual aesthetic, rather more so just instruction for the actual Gala event so I'm not too worried.

                    This week is going to be focused on getting a ready build for the Gala on Thursday! Main focus is finishing up this initial tutorialization phase of production by getting a tutorial room set up that will teach the player the basic mechanics of the game and getting the Ui Input command popups working.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tutorial Room</b><br>
                    This room will be where the player spawns in and learns the mechanics of the game. Basic progression is 1) Teaching the player how to dig fertilizer. 2) Teaching the player how to use fertilizer on sprouts to grow them. 3) Interacting with plants to attack targets. 4) Digging up plants and replanting them. 
                    My goal is to use as little text as possible to communicate the mechanics, just visuals and level design.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Visual Input Commands</b><br>
                    I've been wanting to get this working in the game for the past few weeks but have been a bit stuck in how to go about implementing it. Ideally I would like these UI elements to be entirely iconography rather than using text by having a symbol representing the action and the button it is tied too ( / ). Main issue is that getting all of those action visuals designed will take some time and I feel like using text would be the safer option for the Gala build. I will be creating an asset list for the artists soon so I will be including those icons to use down the line.<br><br>
                    Here is the tutorial level for the gala demo I made, people seemed to like it and more people were able to get the hang of the mechanics and controls.<br><br>

                    <b>Playtest Notes:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Should probably teach players how to plant before showing them how to interact with them. Had a lot of points where players would walk up to the first plant and press B to dig up the plant, and then were confused on what to do next.  </li>
                        <li>players were overwhelmed by the spike in difficulty once enemies are introduced, probably will make the first hive or two only spawn one enemy to help players adjust</li>
                        <li>Second challenge with the hive was a bit hard to teach players, as the only solution was to plant a shooter and turn it in such a way to bounce off a slanted wall. Good puzzle, but probably not the second one to show the player</li>
                    </ul>

                        
                    For the most part I feel good about the content that is in place. There are still some bugs to iron out but design wise seeing people who have never played video games before pick up the controls, mechanics, and gameplay loops was a relief. <br><br>

            <div class="row" >
                
                Over all I am very proud with how this game has shaped and developed. It has been a rocky process and I had to wear many hats durring this first stretch of development, but I'm really excited for the future. Over the course of the past 15 weeks I feel like I have really been challenged to really develop my skills as a producer and project lead, while also testing my design prowes. <br><br>
                This was my first time leading a team of this scale and having to figure out how to effectivley manage my time, and the time of my team mates. There were also a handful of disruptions this semester, like spending the most of weeks 6 and 7 working on Corner Store Lobotomy, attending MDEV on the day our second milestone was due, and basically having the third milestone done 2 weeks early to be ready for the Columbia Gala.<br><br>
                I am very greatful for the team I got to work with on this process, everyone has put in a lot of work and has been amazing to work with. Our artists Evelyn, Kyle, and Larry have all really made this idea come to life and have really brought a lot of excitement to the project, and Oliver has been a great source of advice and has really helped me shape the design of this game.<br><br>
                Speaking of which, this game has been a real design challenge when it came to figuring out the core gameplay and how to effectively teach players gameplay mechanics. A lot of the past 7 weeks have been devoted to this and thus is why there wasn't many new art assets. I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to define my basic core gameplay loop and identity of the game. Some of the original ideas were scrapped or put on hold like the floor timer and slingshot plant, but from that emerged a much stronger core system. Thats why I feel like the next 15 weeks of development are really going to be focused on expanding on this core gamplay and having a lot of fun making new plants, levels, enemies, and much more! We also have a sound team who will be working to get sound effects and music made for the game which is really exciting!<br><br>
                To sum it all up, this has been a challenging stretch. But now I feel like the project is set up to really take off in this second half of development and a lot of the early design work is going to pay off.

            <h2>Week 16 pt. 1: Create Art + SFX Asset lists for Milestone 4</h2>
            <div class="row" >
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                    With the increased number of people involved in this project, and looking back on last semester, I want to start this stage of development by getting some defined lists of what needs to be done so I can make sure there is a steady line up of thigs to do. In the ladder half of last semester I got really caught up in the design of the game that I didn't have much time to get things for artists to do. Now that we have more designers and programmers interested in working on the game, and with the extra time, I want to focus more on honing my producer skills and making sure that we have a good plan for each milestone and can ship something in May.<br>
 <br>
                    For the art asset list, I want to have this all within its own spreadsheet to keep it all centralized for that team, and also since the artists aren't working in GitHub until near the end of the assets creation. However this will not replace GitHub Issues. From my experience from the last few semesters in studio, the GitHub issues are a good way to track what people are actively doing on a week to week basis. This asset spread sheet would be more so for planning out long term production, having something that people can pull from and then bring into GitHub as we reach each milestone. I did some research to figure out a good format, and found a good example from <a href="https://www.artstation.com/blogs/joshuabresler/aaba/adapting-to-and-combining-multiple-art-styles-in-3d-part-1">Joshua Bresler</a> on Art Station that seems to fit the timeline of the class structure that I will be referencing.<br>
 <br>
                    For the Sound Effects list, I did speak with Dani about how that will be formatted, since they have already started production so I will be in communications with them about how to format it.<br>
 <br>
                    Right now I want to focus on the goals for Milestone 4, which I feel should be focused on honing in our aesthetic styles. Safe bet would be just have the demo but with refined art assets, no grey boxing, models for plants, and some core sound effects, but I would like to still showcase some new gameplay features or levels if we can get them done in time. <br>

                    <br>
                    This is most of what I want to see for the first milestone, starting to showcase the visual style of the game in the scope of the last demo. I'm going to speak with the artists on how to best plan this out and if there are any other assets we need to add. I'll be continuously updating this doc through out the semester, but this will be the only post I make for it.

                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                    So for a while I have noticed that the wall plant hasn't been really been adding much to the gameplay. The controls are kinda awkward, the use for it isn't obvious, and there are a lot of technical challenges with it. I got really caught up in the idea of having them grow and wiggle around like actual roots and vines, but it is too slow and doesn't combo with any of the other plants. I also had this issue with the sling shot plant, but decided to just scrap it since I felt its mechanics over complicated its use. However I do feel like we need a wall that the player can set up to defend them self, and also manipulate the battle field in a way to attack the enemy. <br>
 <br>
Over the break was thinking a lot about peoples reactions to the bouncing projectiles, and the puzzles that formed from that. All of those puzzles used diagonal walls naturally found in the level, but I realized that the player should have some way to set up diagonal walls to create their own projectile paths around obstacles. However the main issue with this idea was how do you set up a diagonal line in a square grid? I had ideas for dedicated plants that took up one tile but had a diagonal edge, but felt like that would be hard to effectively hit and set up. But then I came back to the idea of the sling shot plant and came up with this idea:<br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- image here-->
                    <br>
                    The main idea is that it takes the aiming concept of the sling shot and lets the player grow the wall out in the direction in one go. This idea would theoretically be quicker, and easier to learn than the original wall growth pattern. However unlike the sling shot aiming, I want this to be restricted to 8 directions as this will make it really easy to set up projectile bounce paths and make it easier to predict what tiles will be considered "open" to planting. Since I want each end of the wall to land on the center of a tile, the length will vary between diagonals and cardnal directions, but I want to try and aim for the wall to jut out ~3 tiles from the main body.<br>
                    <br>
I also had the idea of having the growth animation also deal damage to enemies that are in the way, creating kind of a pseudo melee attack, giving the wall this duality both as a defense plant and an offensive one in a pinch. I also want to create a aim reticle for this similar to the line renderer but not as long

                <div class="columnHalf">
                    I got the prototype for the new root wall mechanics that I am currently dubbing The Root Spike (not sold). I don't have the UI inputs working for it yet but it works similar to the sling shot where Clay goes behind it to aim, but I took away the inverted stick control thing so the aim arrow lines up with the stick direction. I also added in the damage aspect to the spike so when the wall grows out it deals damage to enemies in the path so the player can have a sort of melee attack thats good with groups of enemies up close. But even aside from that I can see a lot of fun puzzles and levels comprising of just this and the shooter plant so I feel pretty good about these changes<br>

                    We have found some bugs with the current UI Input overlays and have ideas for some new additions to further help the player understand what is happening:
                    <ul>
                    <li>When the player grows a plant the UI doesn't change to the plants control scheme</li>
<li>Each control scheme is hard coded in and difficult to expand upon for specific scenarios</li>
<li>A fertilizer tracker that appears above a plant to show how much it needs to grow. This would most likely be a dial like indicator that fills up as it gains fertilizer</li>
<li>Enemy Spawner Trackers that appears above each active hive on the screen, and when there is an active hive off screen it will stick to the edge of the screen and point in the direction of the spawner</li>
                    </ul>

                    Heres a demo video showcasing the UI changes and updates I made this week. Big new additions are the object trackers I have set to the enemy spawners, and the dial trackers over the plants to track how much fertilizer they have. I did forget to mention in the video but the object trackers could be used to track other objects if we want and have a different icon and such, could be useful in the tutorial area to guide  the players attention. Regardless let me know what you guys think or if you have any suggestions<br>

                <div class="columnHalf">
                    Many people have pointed out that the aiming for planting seeds and interacting with objects is a bit hard as you need to line the player to directly face that object with just the move stick. This will allow the player to rotate around like in a twin stick shooter to aim their character<br>

                    Quick video showcasing the aiming I added to the player so now planting and selecting stuff is a lot easier! One thing I want to talk to animators about is how we want to go about animating Clay when he's looking one way and moving another since it does look kinda awkward. I tried experimenting with having the animation reverse when he's walking backwards but it kinda looked weird. I wouldn't worry so much about so much how to get it work but do you think we should have the top half of the body separate from the legs or have different animations for the 4 cardinal directions and interpolating between those. Those were just my ideas and we can talk more on Friday but this does look a bit funky<br>
 <br>
I also briefly showcased and talked about some updated I made to the fertilizer dial to make it a bit easier on the eyes. TLDR; Going to have the dial fade away when the player is far away and then become full size when they are near.<br>
                    <br>
One other small thing to keep in mind is that I did add the timer to the test projectiles so they will be destroyed after about 4 seconds of being in the air since someone mentioned that last week. <br>

                    This week is going to be a bunch of smaller reworks/adding functionality to existing features based on some of the feedback and discussion with the level designers to experiment with <br>
 <br>
First up is getting the enemy barriers set up as their own prefab object. So far the barriers have worked by just having them as a child object of the Hives that are destroyed when the Hive dies. However it was pointed out that this limits us to only having one Hive per challenge, and people did have ideas for having multiple hives in a section to create danger from different directions. So I want to go ahead and make it its own object with behavior script to add more flexibility to the gates. I have also been told that the sounds for said gate are made so hopefully after this week we would just need the final model and its good to go<br>

            <div class="row" >
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    
                    During our greybox review, one of the most important talking points we had was an issue that has been looming over my head for a while was the issue of running out of Fertilizer. We took some time to discuss some potential solutions and I want to try and prototype some of those ideas to bring into next week and discuss as a group.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Enemies and Hive's drop fertilizer on death
                        <ul>
                        <li>This felt like a pretty popular idea within the group, however this does have some potential holes. While the enemies can spawn from hives forever, creating a theoretical infinite source of fertilizer, if the player has no defenses then they won't be able to kill the enemies to drop the fertilizer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                    <li>Big Fertilizer Deposits Regenerate
                        <ul>
                        <li>The idea with this one was that bigger fertilizer deposits, or at least some sort of variant of them can regenerate at a very slow rate. This could be something to pair with the enemy drops to avoid the aforementioned soft-lock situation, however we didn't like the idea of a player sitting next to the fertilizer deposits just waiting for them to regenerate
                            </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        
                        </li>
                    <li>Smaller Scattered Deposits
                        <ul>
                        <li>As a way to add some more details and guide the player to certain areas, it was suggested that we could have some more smaller fertilizer deposits that are more frequent and scattered through the level. This is similar to an idea I have had for small item crates scattered through out the level. Those crates would be kind of an analogue to Zelda pots, where occasionally they spawn a random item when broken. However, I personally don't like the idea of the player having to walk up each small little crystal and pressing B to dig them up, so I want to experiment with another solution. In Enter the Gungeon there are a lot of set dressing props (like crates, pots, chairs, etc.) that the player can run into and break. They don't drop anything, and other than blocking a single bullet they are pretty useless, but it is so fun to just run through them and break them! I had that idea for the item crates in this game and will most likely do the same with these small deposits
                            </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>

                    Heres a video talking about some of the ideas I implemented that could be potential solutions to the fertilizer problem based on what we discussed last week. I'm a bit rambley so sorry for the tangents about plans for the next few weeks, but I do plan on making a new pass on the pickup items in the coming weeks. Main additions this week are the Small fertilizer deposits, Deposit Regeneration, and dropping fertilizer on object destroy. Small Fertilizer deposits can be quickly ran into to break and gain a small amount of fertilizer, and can be placed around the map to have a smaller passive source of fertilizer. Deposits can now have the option to regenerate at a specified rate, creating time for resources system. And new component has been added which will drop an amount of fertilizer within a range of values when that object has been destroyed. This is used on both the enemies and the hives in the test scene, but can be used on any object that has a collider.<br>

            <div class="row" >
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    For the next demo, I want to rework some issues I have been seeing in regards to understanding the flow of resources as the player makes actions. While this was tackled a while ago with adding the pickup visuals and UI animations, there are some new features and changes that I want to fix:<br>
                    <br>
                    Item Drop Animation + Delay<br>
One thing I mentioned last week was wanting to improve the way the Item Drops behave in game. Currently their objects just spawn in at a position, and instantaneously disappear when near the player. From the start I wanted the drops to have more personality and animated, but when first implemented I was more concerned about making sure everything was working before the aesthetics, but this led to some confusion on where drops are coming from and where they are going. Main things I want to do is have the items be thrown out from their spawned position so they spawn with some movement, and also add a delay to the player picking it up from when it spawned, so the player can see the item drop before it is collected<br>
                    <br>
                    Fertilizer Use<br>
                    When the player is fertilizing a plant, I want there to be a visual line of fertilizer arch from the player, to the target plant. This will communicate not only the direction of fertilizer flow, but also the rate. Rendering the line in an arch might be a challenge but I am sure it is capable within Unity using line renderers.<br>
                    <br>
                    Grid Visualization<br>
                    While not necessarily a resource, I feel like better visualizing the world grid plays a part in this, since it's information that will help the player more efficiently use their resources. Up until now we have been using the Probuilder grids to visualize the world grid and calculate how things line up in gameplay, however probuilder textures aren't going to be making it to the final game, so I feel like it is time to figure out a good way of rendering that to the player in a way that isn't overwhelming or noisy. Could probably figure something out with shaders to make it only appear when the player is close.

            <h2>Week 20 pt.1: Start Transitioning to Cell Shade Rendering for First Lighting Pass</h2>
            <div class="row" >
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    Now entering this next stretch of development, and with some models starting to get textured, I want to begin to transition our default rendering to the cell shaded style that is already present within some of our models. However the fast majority of our game so far utilizes the default URP set up, and does not reflect the final product that we have in mind. So the main goal for this week is to set up a lighting reference scene (most likely based on the tutorial scene) that better reflects the rendering style, with a basic first pass on lighting to get a better idea of what direction we should be going with the aesthetics.<br>
                    <br>

                </div>
                
                <div class="columnHalf">
                    First pass on lighting with the Toon/Cell shading plug in we have! It's been a little funky to use and definitely needs some work to make sure things are balanced, mainly I think adding volume to light. From my research there isn't anything built into unity/URP that can do volumetric lighting so either I'll have to learn to program that shader, or find a plug in. I am more inclined to do the latter for times sake, but still need time to look into options. <br>
For now though this first pass was really interesting and switching everything over to toon shaders wasn't as hard as I thought. We do have some weird discrepancies going on, mainly having a Toon shader - Copy that some of the materials derive from which messed up their shading. That was the case with clays model, so after switching it over he looks a bit different, with flatter shading and an outline. Also small change, clays glasses have an unlit shader attached to them so they will glow in the dark!<br>
One other think I should mention is that I turned on the pixel camera again, I believe it has been off for the past few mile stones, and for the time being it is going to be at HD resolution (1920p x 1080p) so we get some nice crisp edges on the pixels rather than anti aliasing blurring them together, more so an aesthetic touch.

                    Making the grid renderer the other week combined with the playtest notes I got, have me invigorated to finally make a renderer system that will allow the player to see clay when there is a wall between them. I have debated between having this be a silhouette as to preserve the detail of the wall and make it a bit more "secretive" in nature by hiding the other contents, or a full cut out that literally cuts a hole in the wall to show what's on the other side. I went with the latter as I feel it is needed to show the whole level, when the gameplay revolves around placing things in your environment.

                    Here is the first version of the lighting I got set up to mimic the paint over. Leaning a bit darker just because I worry if it gets too bright people wont pick up on the cave vibe. However I feel like the crystals on the walls help outline the boundaries of the rooms so I think it can work. Had to fake some of the emission stuff by upping the bloom in post processing, and adding a light inside the crystals to get it to glow on the toon shaders. Also the spot lights now have volume but that is also a trick of just using a mesh. Definitely a simple and kind of hacky work around, but for the sake of time and lack of resources this will be the best strategy <br>

                    Quick new pass, upped the fill lighting, made the volumes of the sky lights cylinders over cones to prevent them from looking like stage lights. Made the crystals smaller, worry that if we made them too small and bunch them together the overlapping lights will make it too bright so maybe we go for having larger ranged lights that cover multiple crystals?

                    This week I'm going to be working on adding the withering mechanic to the plants. We have thrown around the idea for a while but feel ready to commit to it. Basically plants will lose fertilizer charge over time once they are grown, and when it runs out it will enter into its withered state. For now this will just be a general model that it will change too, but once we get closer with texturing the plants and animating them, we can probably have it be its own animation state that changes its color to a dried plant<br>
                    <br>
 
The rate and causation for losing fertilizer charge will be different depending on the plant. For example, the shooter will lose fertilizer at a constant rate over time, but the root wall should only lose it when an enemy runs into the wall and dies. This will most likely be implemented within the parent class for all plants, so this will be forwards compatible with future plants

                    The plant withering mechanic is implemented and live! Really interested to see how this pans out in the playtesting, but its something I've thought about for a while and I think it turned out well!<br>

                    With some of the changes with fertilizer made this week, I want to prototype out the enemy hostility bar that represents the amount of fertilizer the enemy insects have stolen from the main fertilizer deposit. Nick is going to be prototyping the movement and stealing mechanic, while I add the basic UI overlay functionality and game over sequence. To give an idea of how it will look, I included a picture of the "Impatience Bar" from Against the Storm. This bar charges over time and slowly approaches the skull, but rather than over time it is tied to the enemy insects stealing the fertilizer and then putting it into the Hive machines. I will probably have a +1 fertilizer icon popup over the bar when the enemy returns a piece to the drill, much like what appears over Clay when he picks up an item. My main worry at this stage is how to teach the player this is bad other than trial and error. I think that overlay may help and using basic iconography, but I do worry if we might need tutorial blurbs at some point to effectively teach the player this mechanic. For now this will use place holder art that I can get my hands on, and then pass it to Evelyn to make it pretty<br>

                <div class="columnHalf">
                    Going to work on getting the animations that Larry made for the Hives working in synch with the behavior script. Previously this was just a simple animation clip that raised the model for testing sake, so these will be the finalized animations.<br>
                    <br>

                <div class="columnHalf">
                    Got the animations hooked up, for the most part everything looks great! There were only two things I had of note to talk to Velazquez, Larry about that I touch on the video. First is a slight change to the drill up animation, at the very end when the wasp rail pops up, the wasp shouldn't pop up with it in order to better match the spawn system. The claw on the rail should still pop up, just empty handed. Second is a texture for the hole model that will make it look like a hole. At first I thought maybe just black, but I remember you showing me that shader that created fake 3d space so maybe we can apply that here? Lmk how things look and if anything is off (I'm moving the tracker so its out of the way too)<br>
                    I tweaked the scripting to better line up with the animations and give a better view on the animations. I linked the first spawn to the drill up animation, however I don't have the spawn animation looping like you said. It could in theory, but the issue I had was what if we need to change the spawn rate away from one ever 2 seconds, or how does it stop when it reaches the spawn limit? Basically I just added a state where it is just the claw empty in a static state, and then when an enemy spawn request is made it goes down and grabs it. I'll probably come back to this at a later time to figure out a way to have the enemies "jump" off the top of the drill and onto the ground. Don't have time for it now since that would involve playing around with the physics and navmesh systems
